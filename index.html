        <h2>A Glimpse of Gavi🍃</h2>
        <p class="meta">Praneetha Raju| June 21, 2025</p>
        <p>The Gavi is a village in Kerala's Pathanamthitta district, Gavi offers an unforgettable journey through thick forests, serene lakes, and abundant wildlife, a true paradise for anyone looking to escape into the wild.  The moment we entered the deep forest path, a sense of calm swept over me-the chirping birds,the rustle of leaves,and the cool breeze carried the scent of wild sandalwood.  It wasn't just a trip; it was a connection with the raw,untouched beauty of the western Ghats.</p>
